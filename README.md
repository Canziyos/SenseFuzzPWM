# SenseFuzzPWM
This is an experimental project where I play with fuzzy logic to map different sensor inputs (like ultrasonic distance) to PWM outputs (like buzzers, LEDs, or servos). It’s a sandbox for testing fuzzy memberships (triangular, trapezoidal, Gaussian) and rule sets, and serves as a starting point for multi‑sensor control systems (the foundations added in range_detector repo).
